# todo-app
A to-do list app created with html, javascript, and css


index.html --> contains all the html code \n
reset.css --> simple formatting for the rest of the css code \n
style.css --> contains all the designs for the app \n
main.js --> javascript file that holds code for all the events, stores data for later use, and renders the list items/nodes \n

Since I am continuously using the basic notepad application on my laptop to write out my to-do lists each day, I figured I would make an app to hold all this information, especially because I often do not save my to-do lists, and then the plain txt file in the notepad app is lost if my laptop dies/shuts off. So, this app holds that data, and since I am always writing out the stuff I need to do, this helps keep track of it all, and shows what has been completed, which is convenient as I may forget if I have done certain tasks.
